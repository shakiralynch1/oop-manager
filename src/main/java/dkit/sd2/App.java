//        A reference of type Employee can refer to a Manager because a Manager is an Employee (due to inheritance)
//        A reference of type Manager can NOT refer to an Employee type object, as an employee is not a Manager
//
//        Employee emp = mgr1;  // Is this OK - why or why not?
//
//        Manager mgr  = emp1;  // Is this OK - why or why not?

//      TODO#4 Output only the Managers - use "instanceof" operator and toString()

//      TODO#5  Output only the name and bonus for all Managers (but not Employees)
        // a Cast will be required to convert the reference type from Employee to Manager
        // in order to call the getBonus() method

//      Note that an ArrayList can store a null entry, so the following is valid.
//      Employee emp10 = null;
//      employees.add(emp10);       // what happens?
//      This means that we should normally test to make sure that a reference
//      retrieved from an ArrayList is not null, before we use it.
